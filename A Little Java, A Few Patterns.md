# A Little Java, A Few Patterns

Matthias Felleisen and Daniel P.Friedman Foreword by Ralph E.Johnson

## FOREWORD

Learning to program is more than learning the syntactic and semantic rules of a programming language. It also requires learning how to design programs. Any good book on programming must therefore teach program design.

学习编程不仅仅是学习编程语言的语法和语义规则。还需要学习如何进行程序设计。因此，任何关于编程的好书都必须教程序设计。

Like any other form of design, program design has competing schools. These schools are often associated with a particular set of languages. Since Java is an object-oriented programming language, people teaching Java should emphasize object-oriented design.

像任何其他形式的设计一样，程序设计也有相互竞争的学校。这些学校往往与一套特定的语言联系在一起。既然 Java 是一种面向对象程序设计语言，那么教授 Java 的人应该强调面向对象设计。

Felleisen and Friedman show that the functional (input-output driven) method of program design naturally leads to the use of well-known object-oriented design patterns. In fact, they integrate the two styles seamlessly and how well the work together. Their book proves that the functional design method does not clash with, but supports object-oriented programming.

费莱森和弗雷德曼将函数式（输入-输出驱动）程序设计方法很自然地引导至众所周知的面向对象设计模式。事实上，他们将这两种风格无缝地结合在一起，并且工作得非常好。他们的书证明了函数式设计方法并不与面向对象编程冲突，反而能够很好的支持面向对象编程。

Their success doesn't surprise me, because I’ve seen it in Smalltalk for many years, though unfortunately, it seems to have remained one of the secrets of object-oriented design. I am happy to see that Felleisen and Friedman have finally exposed it. This book will be especially useful if you are a C++ programmer learning Java, since you probably haven't seen functional program design before. If you know functional design, the book will gently introduce you to pattern-based programming in Java. If you don't know it, Felleisen and Friedman will teach you a powerful new way of thinking that you should add to your design toolbox.

他们的成功并没有让我感到惊讶，因为我已经在 Smalltalk 中看到它很多年了，不幸的是，它似乎仍然是面向对象设计的秘密之一。我很高兴看到费莱森和弗雷德曼揭露了这一点。如果你是一个正在学习 Java 的 C++ 程序员，这本书将会特别有用，因为你可能以前从来没有见过函数式程序设计。如果你了解函数式设计，本书将简单地向你介绍 Java 中的基于模式编程。如果你不知道，费莱森和弗雷德曼将教你一种强大的新的思维方式，你应该将它提添加到你的设计工具箱里。

Enjoy the pazzas!
